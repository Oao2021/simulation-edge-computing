# simulation-edge-computing
A python-based simulation model for testing task placement policies in edge servers.
The model is built upon the simpy (https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework. Matplotlib is used in graphing.
For now, only three edge computing servers are modelled, but the script allows for scaling up the number of servers.
Currently, simple scheduling rules can be tested.
